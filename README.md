Name: Project 8
Description: Write several tests, checking the functionality of Urban Routes. The tests will be written in the createAnOrder.e2e.js  (Visual Studio Code) file located in the test/specs folder.
Technologies and techniques used: Visual Studio Code(software) Firefox(browser) and devtools are the technologies used for carrying out the tasks in this project.
Test instructions: Test the Urban Routes app, using the following steps below (note*)each step should be written as an individual test to ensure that whole process of 'Ordering a taxi' functions properly in its entirety. VS Code is the software to write the tests. Firefox or Chrome are the browsers to run the tests, depending on which one works best for your specific computer.

Setting the address
Selecting Supportive plan
Filling in the phone number
Adding a credit card (Tip: the “link” button doesn’t become active until the card CVV field on the “Adding a card” modal id=”code” class=”card-input” loses focus. To change focus you can simulate the user pressing TAB or clicking somewhere else on the screen).
Writing a message for the driver
Ordering a Blanket and handkerchiefs (Tip: there are two selectors to be aware of here. One selector to click on and one to run expect on to verify that the state changed).
Ordering 2 Ice creams
The car search modal appears
Waiting for the driver info to appear in the modal (optional) In addition to the steps above there is an optional step you can check. This one is a bit more tricky than the others but it’s good practice since you will likely encounter more difficult tasks in your career.
